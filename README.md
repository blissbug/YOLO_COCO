# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv3 on COCO Dataset

This repository contains a real-time object detection implementation using YOLOv3 on the COCO dataset. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that is extremely fast and accurate. COCO (Common Objects in Context) is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. This implementation allows you to detect objects in real-time using a pre-trained YOLOv3 model on the COCO dataset.

## Features

- Real-time object detection with YOLOv3.
- Support for a wide range of objects in the COCO dataset.
- Easy-to-use interface for real-time inference.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- PyTorch

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov3-coco-realtime.git
cd yolov3-coco-realtime

Note - You can download yolo v3 weights file from the website.
